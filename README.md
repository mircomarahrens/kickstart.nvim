# Neovim Configuration

I started from [0 to LSP : Neovim RC From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) but using the [lazy package manager](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) and added, as commanded, my own flavor to the environment. :-)

Simple clone this repository to `~/.config/nvim` and start Neovim.

Hint: You need Neovim >= 0.8.0.
