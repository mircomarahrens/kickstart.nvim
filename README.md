# Neovim Configuration

I followed the video [0 to LSP : Neovim RC From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) by [ThePrimeagan](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) but using the [lazy package manager](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) and added, as commanded, my own flavor to it. :-)

Hint: You need Neovim >= 0.8.0.
